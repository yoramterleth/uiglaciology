# Creating a supportive and inclusive environment
Our group strives to be a welcoming and inclusive community in which you, and I, and all of us feel supported and included in our efforts to be the best scientists we can be.  We work hard and acknowledge that research and graduate school is difficult in their own rights. Therefore, we strive to support each other and take care of ourselves.

We welcome members from all different backgrounds.

### GitHub <span class="fab fa-github"></span>

[GitHub](https://github.com/){:target="_blank"} is a popular web service for hosting Git repositories--with benefits!
It provides a handy web interface for editing and collaborating on repos, as well as, built in project management features and [free static web hosting](https://pages.github.com/){:target="blank"} powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/){:target="blank"}.
Accounts are free.
To learn more check out Hello World on [GitHub Guides](https://guides.github.com/){:target="_blank"} or [GitHub Training](https://services.github.com/on-demand/){:target="_blank"}.

### Jekyll 

[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/){:target="blank"} is a popular static site generator that is built into [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/){:target="blank"} free web hosting service.

- [go-go gh-pages](https://evanwill.github.io/go-go-ghpages/) (workshop)

### Markdown

[Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) is a standard to simplify writing content for the web. 
[GitHub markdown flavor](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/) can be used any where on GitHub and in Jekyll.

- [Markdown in a Minute](https://evanwill.github.io/_drafts/notes/markdown-minute.html)
- GitHub Guide [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
- [Dillinger](https://dillinger.io/) (web based markdown editor)

# Text Editor

When working with code you should have a good text editor.
Windows notepad does not handle UTF-8 encoding or UNIX line endings that are standard for cross platform applications. 
For basic editing, Windows [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/), Mac TextEdit, or Linux Gedit are sufficient.
However, a more complete code editor will be helpful for managing Jekyll projects.

Open-source cross platform suggestions:

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Atom](https://atom.io/)
